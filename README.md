# Wishly

Still a work in progress.

## Running the app locally

Run the app with `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`. This will start both the server as 
well as the Sidekiq worker.

## Running tests

To run the entire test suite, first install all required gems with `bundle install` and run `bundle exec rspec`.
